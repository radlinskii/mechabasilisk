# Mechabasilisk

![finished mechabasilisk keyboard picture](/images/photo1.jpeg)

Mechabasilisk is an **ergonomic**, **split**, **40%**, **key-welled**, **handwired** keyboard.

It is programmed on two [WeAct RP2040](https://github.com/WeActStudio/WeActStudio.RP2040CoreBoard) boards.\
It uses **TRRS cable** for communication between the boards.

The case was designed in [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview), and the archive files are in [fusion](/fusion/) directory.\
STL files can be found in [stl](/stl/) directory.\
Firmware was created using [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/) and is stored in [qmk_firmware](/qmk_firmware/) directory.\
You can also find some more images in [images](/images/) directory.

### Why the name?

This is a more badass (more tented and more edgy) version of the [Basilisk](https://github.com/radlinskii/basilisk) keyboard I created.\
So as Mechagodzilla was created to confront Godzilla, Mechabasilisk is going to try to confront and replace Basilisk in my daily usage.

And still looking from the top view, it reminds me of the Basilisk monster.
